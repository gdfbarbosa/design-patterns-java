### Design Patterns

This is a repository used for practicing the use of design patterns, as seen in the book "Design Patterns" by the four authors known as "The Gang of Four".

Important to note that there are some examples taken from the excellent site about design patterns, [Refactoring Gurus](https://refactoring.guru/).

And some patterns were modified by me for learning purposes.

Feel free to collaborate or create your own if it makes sense for you.
